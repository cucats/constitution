== Executive Committee

The day-to-day management of the Society is the responsibility of the Executive Committee. This body consists of:
- A President
- A Vice-President
- A Junior Treasurer
- A Secretary
- A Senior Treasurer

== Senior Treasurer

The Senior Treasurer shall be a member of the Regent House, or other person approved
by the Junior Proctor. The Senior Treasurer must be appointed by the elected members of The Executive Committee and must be ex officio a member of The Executive Committee. The Senior Treasurer shall ensure that there is in place proper finance, administration and regulation of the Society.

== Decision Making

Hereafter, any decision mentioned as requiring the approval of the Executive Committee requires the approval of at least two of the President, Vice-President, Junior Treasurer, and Secretary unless otherwise specified.

== Delegation of Responsibilities

In order to aid with day-to-day operations, the Executive Committee may delegate responsibilities to other members entirely at its discretion. These members are hereafter referred to as the Committee and hold no special power unless explicitly specified by the Executive Committee in writing.

== Elections

The Executive Committee, except for the post of Senior Treasurer, shall be first proposed and seconded by two other members. Then they shall be elected using Single Transferable Vote by a secret ballot if there are more than two candidates for a post, following candidate hustings at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). The voting process may be conducted online.

== Nominations <nominations>

Nominations for a new Executive Committee must be submitted to the outgoing President, who shall act as the Returning Officer for the Election.

== Eligibility

Candidates for the Executive Committee must be Society Members in good-standing and current members of the University at the time of their election.

Candidates for the roles of President, Vice-President, Junior Treasurer and Secretary shall be full-time undergraduate or master's students of the University of Cambridge.

== Reopening of Nominations

Should no candidate stand for one or more of the positions or the election results in a call for reopening of nominations (RoN), these positions will be made open to all Society Members. The nomination process in @nominations must still be followed. Additional hustings may take place at the discretion of the Returning Officer.

== Election Procedures

The timeline and procedures for each Election shall be set by the Returning Officer and made public on, or before, the date of opening nominations. Such procedures shall adhere to, and be interpreted in accordance with, relevant provisions of this Constitution.

== Handover

The Executive Committee members elected in the annual Lent election shall take office at the Board of Advisors meeting or by the end of Easter Full Term, whichever is sooner.

== Vacancies

If any Executive position becomes vacant during the Full Tenure of the Executive Committee, the remaining Executives may appoint an existing member of the Society Committee to the vacant position. This appointment shall be agreed upon unanimously by the remaining members of the Executive Committee and documented. If such an appointment is not possible, an Election for the role shall be held following the procedures established for the most recent Election.

== Removal from Office <removal-from-office>

In the event that two members of the Executive Committee lack confidence in the ability of the other member of the Executive Committee to fulfil the requirements of their position, that member can be removed from their position and a new member can be appointed.

== Suspension of Membership

The Executive Committee shall have the right to suspend the membership of any person whose actions it deems to be damaging to the Society or its reputation at its discretion.

Such expulsion shall be undertaken in accordance with @disciplinary-processes, and is subject to confirmation at the next General Meeting of the Society.

= Financial and Liability Matters

== University Registration

For so long as the Society shall be Registered with the Junior Proctor, it shall be the duty of The Executive Committee to ensure that The Society complies with the requirements for Registration as a University Society.

== Contractual Arrangements <contractual-arrangements>

The Executive Committee (acting by its members) is authorised to enter into contractual arrangements with third parties for and on behalf of all members, but only to the extent reasonably necessary for the proper performance of its duties pursuant to the constitution and acting always in the best interests of the Society and its members. Non-Executive Committee members are not entitled to enter into contractual arrangements for and on behalf of other members unless expressly authorised in writing by the Executive Committee.

== Contractual Liability

When entering into contractual arrangements pursuant to @contractual-arrangements, the Executive Committee shall endeavour to agree a contractual limit on the members' liability which does not exceed the assets of the Society from time to time, or, if not possible, a reasonable limit of liability taking into account the nature of the contract and the circumstances.

= Meetings

== Calling Meetings

Meetings can be called at any point by the President.

The President, or in their absence the Vice-President, Secretary or Junior Treasurer, shall take the Chair at any meeting.

Meeting minutes for every meeting shall be produced by the Secretary. In their absence, another member of the meeting should be elected to take minutes for that meeting.

Minutes of the meeting must be available upon request for any member of the society.

== Motions

Every motion at a General Meeting shall be proposed and seconded by two other members.

== Extraordinary General Meetings

An Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) may be held at any time during Full Term. It shall be held in Cambridge and may be called by the Executive Committee or at the written request of at least ten members. Twenty-one days written notice shall be given to members before an EGM is held. An EGM shall have the same powers as an AGM.

= Equality of Opportunity

The society is committed in its pursuit of sporting excellence to equality of opportunity and to a proactive and inclusive approach to equality, which supports and encourages all under-represented groups, promotes an inclusive culture, and values diversity.

The society is committed to everyone having the right to enjoy CUCaTS activities in an environment free from threat of intimidation, harassment and abuse.

The society has a responsibility to oppose discriminatory behaviour and promote equality of opportunity.

The society will deal with any incidence of discriminatory behaviour seriously, in accordance with the society's disciplinary procedures outlined in @disciplinary-processes.

= Disciplinary and Complaints Processes <disciplinary-processes>

== Disciplinary Actions

The Executive Committee shall have the authority to expel or to suspend a member or members whose actions are felt to be such as to bring the society into disrepute, or to adversely affect the smooth running of the Society in a major way. This may only be performed by a majority vote of the Executive Committee members, excluding the Senior Treasurer.

The Executive Committee may also take other disciplinary action in respect of a member of the society, commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. The Executive Committee may take action as a result of member behaviour within any society-organised activities.

In the event of an expulsion, the excluded member is required to return all equipment, documents and finances belonging to the society within 7 days. They will not be entitled to any full or partial refund of annual or lifetime membership fees.

== Appeals Process <appeals-process>

If the excluded or suspended member — or a former President, Vice-President, Junior Treasurer or Secretary that was demoted by the process specified in @removal-from-office — wishes to appeal the decision, that appeal should be made to the Senior Treasurer who will consider all the facts and whose decision will be final. An appeal as to the process of exclusion, suspension or demotion, but not a further investigation into the facts, may be lodged with the Junior Proctor.

= Dissolution of the Society

== Dissolution Process

The Society may be dissolved at a meeting provided that at least twenty-one days written notice of the intention to dissolve the Society has been given to the members. At least two thirds of those present and voting must vote in favour of the motion for Dissolution for it to be effective.

== Asset Distribution

Any motion for Dissolution of the Society shall provide that assets remaining after all liabilities have been met shall be transferred either to another Registered University Society, or to the Societies' Syndicate.

= Provision of Information

The Executive Committee must supply annual accounts to the Senior Treasurer and the University in accordance with the rules and regulations of university societies laid out by the Junior Proctor.

= Declaration

CUCaTS hereby adopts and accepts this constitution as its current constitution regulating the actions of members and administrators, and will also comply with all University and legal requirements.
